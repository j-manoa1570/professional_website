                            <h3>Personal Concert</h3>
                            <p>The idea that we (Jason Chio, Colby Robbins, and I) had was that we wanted to build a dynamic LED lighting system that could be installed into a car that will change according to music coming off the amp. The main hardware that was used was an Arduino Pro Mini and a custom built low band filter module. Additionally, we had a Bluetooth module to connect to so that the lighting system could be controlled by Bluetooth via Mobile device however, due to time constraints for the class, we did not implement it at that time. Project video can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/610oPO6CUys">here</a>.</p>

                            <h3>Machine</h3>
                            <p>Machine is a collaborative tool that has an IM service and integrates tools such as Trello, github, file management, and other tools that are useful tools for teams. The original idea came from a project for my Web Engineering II (back end development). At that time, I didn't see any options like this available for Slack (2017) but have found since then that Slack has integrated these essential development team tools. </p>
                            <p>I decided upon the name through inspiration from one of my favorite albums, Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here." I am unsure at this point if I want to pursue further development of this project.</p>

                            <h3>Senior Project</h3>
                            <p>I have not done my senior project yet. I have an idea for what I want to do for it. I want to build a wireless DMX controller system that can be controlled with a Raspberry Pi sending data via Bluetooth to an Arduino that is directly connected to the DMX fixture. This will give flexibility for those simple DMX fixture setups for things such as store fronts that will use a static lighting or halloween decorations. Once the various fixture scenes are created, the system will read the data sent by the Arduino via DMX and will run autonomously. The user can then leave the system running and no additional modifications will be requred.</p>
